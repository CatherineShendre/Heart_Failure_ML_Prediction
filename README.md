# Heart_Failure_ML_Prediction
The Heart Failure Prediction Kaggle Dataset used to determine which factors such as age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, ejection fraction, creatinine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, and serum sodium, could be major causes of heart failure.
Some crucial steps include: Cleaning and manipulating the data, EDA, and feature selection were performed in such a way that the algorithm could generate a model with effective performance.
